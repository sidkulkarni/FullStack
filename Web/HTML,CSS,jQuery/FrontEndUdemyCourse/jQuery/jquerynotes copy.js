Selcting with Jquery:

jQuery Selectors:

Objectives:
1) Select elements with $()
2) Use .css() to style elements.

Selecting with jQuery:
$("selectorGoesHere")

Selecting with jQuery is very similar to querySelectorAll, in that we provide 
a CSS style selector and jQuery will return all matching elements.

So unlike vanilla JS:
document.getElementByID();
document.querySelector();
document.querySelectorAll();
document.getElementByClassName();
document.getElementByTagName();

The $ sign in jQuery will replace all of them. It basically works like 
querySelectorAll() in that we give it a CSS style selector and then jQuery will
return all the matching elements.
