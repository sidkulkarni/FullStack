<!-- Specificity: Is this idea in CSS that we can have multiple styles targetting one element. -->

<!-- In this case, we have multiple styles, targetting this one ul. Or this li for instance.

The li is being targetted by the body turning it red.
and it also being targetted by line 10 which indicates to make all ul's blue.

So CSS has to decide which one wins. In this case, whatever style is closest to this element wins.
(Ex: Body is very general,ul is very specific. ul is going to win.)
 -->

<!-- The closest selector to the element wins -->

<body>
<p>Hello!!!</p>

<!-- 
Magnitude of Specificity:
(Increasing order of magnitude.)

(a) Type Selectors

li{
	
}

li a{
	
}

li + a{
	
}

(b)Class, Attribute, and Pseudo-Class Selectors

.hello{
	
} 

input[type="text"]{
	
}

(c)ID Selectors

#hello -->
